            <h3>4 Apps I Like</h3>
            
            <list> 
                <ul>Headspace</ul>
                <p>I love Headspace for so many reasons. A the app itself is wonderfully designed and full of positive and cute animations. Secondly, the app’s meditation exercises are perfect for sleep, mindfulness, letting go, reconnecting, and calming down. The app has helped me to build a healthy habit of taking time out of my day for myself.</p>
                
                <ul>Libby</ul>
                <p>Libby is one of my favorite apps because it allows me to read my library books wherever I go. The app’s library browsing is easy to navigate to find new books to read and I really appreciate the estimated waitlist times Libby factors when you reserve a new book. The app’s reader is simple and straightforward enough for me to keep coming back for more new books.</p>
                
                <ul>Music Memos</ul>
                <p>Music Memos is a fantastic app for anyone who uses the regular voice memo app to record instrument snippets or ideas. Music Memos records your idea in a high quality file and transcribes it from tempo to chords uses. The best part is that the app comes with a bass and drum generator that will follow your music memo. Each of the virtual instruments have wonderful customization to fit the flow and feel of the voice memos you record.</p>
            
                <ul>Spotify</ul>
                <p>Spotify is my end all be all. I would go crazy if I didn’t have an organized and centralized place to listen to all my music, make playlists, and discover new music. The podcast feature on Spotify is one I have been only recently diving into and I regret not opening myself to the world of pods sooner. My favorite part of Spotify is the ease of use it has in sharing music with your friends or a brand new playlist you’re really proud of. Overall, a useful app I open at least 10 times on the daily.</p>
