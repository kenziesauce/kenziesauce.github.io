        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Makenzie Van Vooren and I was born in San Diego, California. My family moved to Long Beach, California shortly after I was born and have lived here my whole life since. I define myself as an outside thinker and an ambitious dreamer who fell in love with design. I was homeschooled my whole life and owe my outside-of-the-box thinking to that; being educated outside of a classroom meant I was challenged with problems I had to solve on my own. I have an immense love of music and compose tunes in my free time while hanging out with my cat, Rocket. I love a quality cup of coffee with a piece of shortbread to start day and a breakfast burrito. I hope to use my passion of design to build community and empower LGBTQ youth and people of color by designing informative and accessible work for nonprofits and charities. I also hope to be designing for the musical instrument industry.</p>

        <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
            <p>Design should be accessible and meaningful. The responsibility of a designer is the convey information to the public in the most universal way. The beauty of design comes through straightforward design that anyone can read and understand because information is power and empowering others should be the goal of design. Design should also be fun. There are too many ways for cynicism and dismay to creep into the mind on a daily basis that the designer should strive to be above that. Humor is a universal language and calls to action positivity and comfort. Design should also call people to action. If the purpose of design is to inform the public and not anything further, it is not effective design.</p>
